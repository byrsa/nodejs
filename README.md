This tutorial walk you through creating an internet of things application using Node.js running from a PC as an emulator. Any device that can run node.js can easily push data to s2c.io.

In order to show how node.js works with s2c.io, we need to implement the example shown in the blog diagram above. In this example, we have a gateway connected to two sensors: sensor0 and sensor1. the first sensor measures battery, distance and current. The second sensor measures pressure and voltage. We need to collect the data from the sensors and send it over the internet and visualize from anywhere in the world.

At the end of the tutorial, you will learn:

1- Add a device to s2c.io

2- Add sensors

3- Create an application to visualize data in real-time

4- Add a user who can view the visualized data

5- Add alerts to receive emails when a condition is met in the field
